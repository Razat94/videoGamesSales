# <p align="center"> Video Game Sales Analysis </p>

## What is this?
This is a simple Python Notebook that was used to analyze video game sales


## Where did the data come from?
I got the data from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/gregorut/videogamesales)
Additionally, I have the csv file located in the same directory. You can see it [here](vgsales.csv)

## Where can I see the notebook?
You should be able to see it [here](vgsales.ipynb)

## Why did you decide to analyze this set of data?
I've used to play console games when I was younger, so I was curious to see if I can learn anything from the data set.

## What have you learned from analyzing the data?
I'd say the most interesting graph was this: 
<div align = "center">
  <img src = "img/gbaGamesPerYear">
  <p> In essence, video games for the Game Boy Advance came out only from 2000 through 2007.
      Additionally, the amount of video games for the GBA in 2003 was fewer than the amount created in 2002 and 2004. 
</div>

## Are you done with this notebook?
Probably not. I'll keep on making changes as I see fit. Personally, I loved this dataset because it's really straight-forward. 
Having said that, if you find any further ways to analyze the data, please shoot me an e-mail at
